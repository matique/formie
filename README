Formie
======

Tired of programming each HTML tag? Are you in search of DRYness for Rails
views? May be Formie can help you.

Formies is a low level template-based rendering engine. It injects
the formies into the ActionView module. The form-bounded as well as
the unbounded templates are supported. Still, the ActionView
functionality (e.g. text_field) is kept untouched.


Templates for Formie are hosted in:
  app/views/formie/forms      (bounded to form)
  app/views/formie/templates  (free standing)

Inside a formie the following locals (as delivered by the
controller) are available:
  action_name
  args          remainings after extracting options/locals
  controller_name
  form          (available inside formie_for (similar to fields_for))
    form.object
  params

Further locals can be passed over by a hash.

The controller attributes are available as usual.

Warning: a change in a template requires a server restart.


Example
